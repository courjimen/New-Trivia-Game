### How to install this project locally
First clone my project and run this in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/courjimen/New-Trivia-Game.git

Open in your code editor (I use VS Code) and split the terminal into two separate terminals.

On terminal one:

```bash
cd server
node server.js
```

On terminal two:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
Server should be running on localhost 3000 on terminal one. Follow the link provided in terminal two and it will display the Trivia Game!
